3. Run each cell sequentially to execute the code.
4. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook for each task.

## Tasks Covered

1. Speech-to-Text Conversion
2. Text-to-Speech Synthesis
3. Generating Interview Questions

## Directory Structure

- `saved_models/`: Directory for saving trained models.
    - `text_to_speech/`: Saved text-to-speech model.
    - `speech_to_text/`: Saved speech-to-text model.
    - `mistral/`: Saved Mistral model.

## Additional Notes

- The notebook utilizes various Hugging Face models and libraries for different tasks.
- Ensure you have sufficient disk space available, especially if you're saving models.
- For optimal performance, consider running the notebook on a machine with GPU support.

Feel free to modify the notebook as needed for your specific use case or extend its functionality.
